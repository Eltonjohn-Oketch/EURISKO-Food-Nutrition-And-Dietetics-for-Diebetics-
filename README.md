# EURISKO (Food Nutrition And Dietetics for Diebetics) Nutrition Recommendation system.

# Introduction

The project detailed here attempts to build a machine learning model that will help classify individuals to whether they have diebetes or not,then further recommend foods to both the classified classes independently.

Project Overview(Description)

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases, diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose (blood sugar) is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food we eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes the body does not make enough or any insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Food is among the most basic needs for the control of diabetes. Proper dietary habits can generally promote good health. However, each person’s diet needs are typically varied based on some individual factors including gender, age, and physical differences or health status. In addition, each person usually differs in terms of food preference. Thus a diet selection that balances between the individual need and preference is often challenging.
In this regard, a food nutrition recommendation system would be helpful. A food nutrition and recommendation system is a model which suggests the best diets according to a patient's health situation and preferences. The system recommends food based on the users’ age, blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, insulin and  diabetes pedigree function.
